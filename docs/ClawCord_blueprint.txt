Got it. **ClawCord** can basically be a “bring-your-own-signal-agent” layer on top of OpenClaw that drops into Discord trench servers and produces *policy-driven* calls for Solana tokens—without pretending to be omniscient, and without being a security nightmare.

Below is a concrete, buildable blueprint that matches how OpenClaw’s Discord channel works (bot token, mention policy, per-channel sessions, etc.). ([openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai/integrations))

---

## What ClawCord is (product definition)

**ClawCord = “Signal Caller as a Policy Engine”**
- Users/admins add a bot to their Discord server.
- They choose a **Signal Policy** (preferences + guardrails + data sources + thresholds).
- The agent:
  - watches specified channels / messages / links / tickers,
  - optionally polls whitelisted data feeds on a cadence,
  - emits **standardized “call cards”** (entry thesis + risk flags + invalidation + liquidity/holders/volume/age + confidence + why-now),
  - and keeps an auditable log of *why* it said what it said.

**Key framing:** you’re not selling “alpha.” You’re selling **automation + consistency + configurable taste** (“ultimate signal caller”) and the **control plane** that makes it safe and non-ruggy.

---

## Non-negotiables (so this doesn’t get you cooked)

### 1) Don’t allow “free-form financial advice”
Your UX should force “call outputs” into a structured template:
- **What it is:** token + market context
- **Why it’s interesting:** objective triggers that fired
- **Risks:** objective red flags
- **What would invalidate:** conditions that would make the thesis wrong
- **Confidence:** bounded + explainable (not vibes)

This keeps it useful *and* reduces “guarantee/insider” vibes.

### 2) Hard safety rails on Discord
OpenClaw’s Discord integration already supports secure defaults like **DM pairing** and allowlists, and isolates sessions by guild channel IDs. Lean into that.

Practical defaults you want:
- **requireMention=true** in shared channels (only respond when @mentioned)
- per-channel allowlists for who can run config commands
- disable bot-to-bot loops
- explicit opt-in for “autopost calls on schedule”

### 3) Observability + receipts
Every call should have:
- a deterministic **call_id**
- inputs (data snapshots / message link refs)
- rules triggered
- versioned policy hash
- model + prompt version
- who changed config + when

## MVP scope that ships fast (and feels “ultimate”)

### A) Discord-first integration (weekend build)

**MVP features**
1. `/clawcord install` – posts setup checklist + permissions check
2. `/clawcord policy set` – choose preset (see below)
3. `/clawcord watch add` – add sources:
   - token addresses
   - tickers (resolved to mint)
   - wallet(s) / deployer(s)
   - twitter handles / links (optional later)
4. `/clawcord call now <token>` – generates a call card on demand
5. `/clawcord autopost on|off` – cadence + quiet hours + max/day
6. `/clawcord thresholds` – sliders (min liq, min vol, max age, etc.)
7. `/clawcord logs` – last 20 calls + reasoning summary + link to “receipts”

### B) “Policy Packs” (what makes it feel premium)
Offer 5–8 built-in policies that reflect real trench preferences:

- **Fresh Scanner (0–2h)**: ultra-new launches, strict rug filters, low post rate
- **Momentum (2h–48h)**: volume acceleration + social velocity + chart structure
- **Dip Hunter**: drawdown + reclaim conditions + liquidity stability
- **Whale Follow**: wallet-cluster watchlist + accumulation patterns
- **Deployer Reputation**: deployer history + prior rugs/abandoned charts flags
- **Community Strength**: holder growth, retention, distribution, chatter quality

Each policy is just a named set of thresholds + enabled signals.

## Technical architecture (clean + shippable)

### 1) Base: OpenClaw Gateway + Discord channel
- You run OpenClaw locally or on a small VM.
- Configure Discord bot token and guild/channel rules.
- OpenClaw already isolates guild channel sessions which is perfect for per-server configuration separation.

### 2) ClawCord as an OpenClaw “skill”
OpenClaw is designed around “skills” and community integrations via ClawHub.

Your skill provides:
- **commands**: parse slash commands + config writes (optionally)
- **data fetchers**: Solana RPC / indexers / pricing endpoints
- **scoring engine**: turns raw metrics → normalized scores
- **renderer**: outputs “call cards” with consistent formatting
- **storage**: per-guild policy + watchlists + logs

### 3) Data layer (pragmatic)
You’ll want 3 categories of signals:

**On-chain / market**
- price/volume/liquidity
- holders count, concentration, top holders delta
- token age, mint authority/freeze authority
- dev wallet actions, LP changes, supply changes

**Social / attention (optional in v1)**
- twitter mentions velocity for ticker/mint links
- discord message spikes in watched channels

**Heuristics**
- “bundle-ish” distributions, suspicious holder graphs
- deployer reuse patterns
- abnormal LP behavior

### 4) Control plane UI (v1 can be Discord-only)
Discord-only is fine initially, but the SaaS moment is a web dashboard:
- server list
- policy editor
- logs + backtests
- billing + seat-based access

## Monetization that matches trench reality

**Two-sided model works best:**
1) **Server SaaS**: monthly per Discord server
2) **Pro Policies**: paid policy packs + private policy import
3) **White-label** for token communities
4) **Enterprise**: internal comms automation

Avoid charging per call; charge for **control + reliability**.

## “Ultimate signal caller” without being corny: output format

Every call message should look like:

- **$TOKEN** (mint) — *Policy: Momentum v2*
- **Trigger(s):** vol +180%/30m, liq stable, holders +9%/2h
- **Pros:** X, Y, Z
- **Risks:** top-10 concentration high, LP young, deployer unknown
- **Invalidation:** breaks below VWAP + volume dies
- **Confidence:** 6.5/10
- **Receipts:** links/snapshots

## Build prompt you can paste into your dev agent

You are building “ClawCord”, a Discord-integrated signal-caller product implemented as an OpenClaw skill.

Constraints:
- Must use OpenClaw’s Discord channel integration patterns.
- Must NOT provide unstructured financial advice.
- Must be secure by default.

Deliverables:
1) Repo structure for an OpenClaw skill named clawcord
2) Implement Discord slash commands
3) Policy system with presets
4) Data provider interfaces with stubs
5) Storage for per-guild config + logs
6) Structured Call Card output

Also produce:
- a threat model,
- a deployment guide,
- and a no-hallucinations rule.

Proceed step-by-step and generate production-grade TypeScript.
